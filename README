This repository contains R implementation of the algorithm proposed in "Spatiotemporal prediction of infectious diseases using structured Gaussian processes with application to Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever", which is appearing in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases.

structured_gpr_demo.R file shows how to use the regression algorithm in R.

SGPR methods
------------
* structured_gpr_train.R => training procedure for regression in R
* structured_gpr_test.R => test procedure for regression in R
